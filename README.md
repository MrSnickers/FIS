# Flatiron School Assignments

This is a consolodated repo of my assignments while at the [Flatiron School's Full-Stack Immersive Bootcamp](https://flatironschool.com/programs/nyc-software-engineering-immersive/).  They are mostly written in [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) in the [`Sinatra`](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) or [`Rails`](http://rubyonrails.org/) frameworks, although some of the smaller assignments were rewritten in ES5.

## Getting Started
