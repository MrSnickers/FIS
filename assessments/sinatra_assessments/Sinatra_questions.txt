Now, answer these questions:

What is Sinatra? Where does it run?
  Sinatra is a lightweight Ruby framework for making websites.  Sinatra runs on a server.  This particular project right now is the localhost inside my computer.

  A Gemflie informs the server what gems are required to run my application and where to download them.  It is used by creating a file called 'Gemfile', providing the information where gems are kept online such as rubygems.org, and listing all the gems required for the app.

What is an ORM? What are the basic features of an ORM? Why is it helpful?

What is the public folder? What do we use it for?
  The public folder keeps all the assets that make my application look pretty, but are not required for it to function.

What is REST? Why is it useful?
  REST is a system of manipulating data by means of URL requests.  It is pretty spiff as it is simple and standardized.

Suppose I, with my browser, send an HTTP get request to the route that will render the view of all the SpaceCats. Walk me through step by step how your application handles that request.
  My application receives the request and matches the url to a route.  It then executes the logic in the route and ultimately will pass required variables to the view when it accesses it.
